Erwin Smith leads one last charge - 'Attack on Titan'


Everything that you thought had meaning: every hope, dream, or moment of 
happiness. None of it matters as you lie bleeding out on the battlefield. None 
of it changes what a speeding rock does to a body, we all die. But does that 
mean our lives are meaningless? Does that mean that there was no point in our 
being born? Would you say that of our slain comrades? What about their lives? 
Were they meaningless?...

They were not! Their memory serves as an example to us all! The courageous 
fallen! The anguished fallen! Their lives have meaning because we the living 
refuse to forget them! And as we ride to certain death, we trust our successors 
to do the same for us! Because my soldiers do not buckle or yield when faced 
with the cruelty of this world!

My soldiers push forward! My soldiers scream out! My soldiers RAAAAAGE!
